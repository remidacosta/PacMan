PacMan by Rémi DA COSTA and Nassère ABDOU-RAHIMI

It was a school project made with JAVA and JavaFX.

You can play the original game with the button "Jouer" and then "Partie classique"
Also you can play a funny PacMan, where the map is bigger and walls are created  randomly with the button "Partie arcade"

We added more fun with many options, like powers. Powers are created randomly on the map (with any game mode)
When the pacman pick up a power, it can use it with the button SPACE.
The blue power (if you pick up the power, you will see an icon at the left bottom corner of the game)
allow the pacman to cross any wall of the map once.
The orange power create a teleporter on the wall in front of the pacman (an idea from an other game : Portal)

Also, you can create your own map with the editor mode and then save your maps and load a map after that.


Have a look and enjoy ! ;-)
